(i) Create a dictionary that contains the atomic element symbol and its name.
(ii)Add a unique & duplicate element into this dictionary by interacting with the user.
Observe the output and justify it.
(iii) Display the number of atomic elements in this dictionary
(iv) Ask the user to enter an element to search in the dictionary. Display appropriate
results.
Rewrite this program so that these operations are inside a function called
‘AtomicDictionary’. Create another python file called “Atomic.py” and execute this
function in it.
